A Jekyll theme for blogging. With the ability to sort posts by category and list various authors in an authors block, this theme is perfect for collaborative projects.

# How to use it
1. Star & fork the [repo][repo]
2. Rename the repo and clone the master branch to your local directory
3. Customize the `_config.yml` file to represent you
4. Download Gulp to get the most out of this theme (compiling Jade/Sass, browser refresh etc.)

**When using a local server** change the url in the `_config.yml` to your server address. Make sure to change it back to your domain before you deploy.

##Author blocks
Author blocks are populated based on each post in the `_posts` folder. The author **name**, **title**, **bio**, and **social media** links are all defined in the YAML at the top of ever post page.

If you're only going to feature posts from one author, or default to that author primarily, you can define these values in the `_config.yml` file, just like you do for url, and sitename. This will require you change the tags in the `_layouts/posts.html` file.
