<h1 class='nunito'>Hey, how's it hanging? My name is Nina, welcome to my site.</h1>

<p class='big'>
	This site serves a few purposes... It’s the catch-all for many of the Jekyll Themes that I’ve created, as well as the dumping ground for various homework (yes, homework) exercises for my Javascript class. Along with that I use it to casually blog and promote myself and my work.
